They contain:

    (1) The preprocessed dataset (.CSV files) available on the link:  https://git.app.uib.no/biomedvis2025/31p-mrs-redesign/-/tree/main/data?ref_type=heads  
    provided by the Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE 2025 organizers through  the page http://biovis.net/2025/biovisChallenges_vis/.

    (2) The figures and tables file contains

          i.	The original plot (Figure 1) by Fear et al[1]

          ii.	The proposed visualization (Figure 2) and the associated navigational exploration and analytical interaction screenshots (Figure 3 – 8).

          iii.	The outputs: PEAK comparison 

                  a.	The bar chart, Figure 9: shows Metabolite peak comparison. It compares the average peak per metabolite, between control and MT conditions across all subjects.

                  b.	The bar Chart Figure 10: Shows the difference of the average peak between conditions (MT - control)

                  c.	Table 1:  Summarizes Figures 9 & 10 using numeric data and includes percentage difference(change).

                  d.	Table 2: shows the paired t-test with p-vlaues and significant stars column.

          iv.	The outputs: PEAK RATIO comparison 
                  a.	The bar chart, Figure 11: shows Metabolite ratio comparison, which compares the average peak ratio between control and MT conditions across all subjects.
                  
                  b.	The bar chart Figure 12: shows difference in average peak ratio between conditions (mean_MT – mean_control)
                  
                  c.	Table 3: Summarizes Figures 11 & 12 using numeric data and includes percentage difference(change).
                  
                  d.	Table 4: Shows the paired t-test with p-vlaues and significant stars column.
